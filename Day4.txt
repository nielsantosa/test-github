Side Effect -> Changing something outside the iterator
=> Which is to be more careful!
=> Try to be avoided

How to avoid this side effect :
=> Create a method
=> Use <array>.map method



def musicians_with_instruments(musicians)
	musicians.map.with_index { |m, index| "#{m} - #{INSTRUMENTS[index]} "}
end


each -> only iterate, but doesn't return anything
map -> will give a new copy of new array. -> FOR SIDE EFFECT USE THIS

musicians.map { |musician| musician.upcase } 

Yield inside a method to run the block inside do

() : bracket / parentheses
[] : square bracket
{} : curly bracket
