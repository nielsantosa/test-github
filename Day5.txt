Hash # -> Python's Dictionary
General consensus :

students_hash = {
	"key1" => value,
	"key2" => value,
	"key3" => value
}

stt shortcuts (Need to learn)
Shortcut for selecting duplicate name
Shortcut for selecting multiple value
Shortcut to change a non-string to string -> Highlight the text, click the "


Another way to write hash (symbol is more performant as identifier:

students_has = {
	:key1 => value1,
	:key2 => value2,
	:key3 => value3
}

:<symbol> is called symbol.
Different between symbol and string as a key
string -> the object id will change every time you change the value
symbol -> the object id will not change (will be always there)

Latest development from ruby (to follow the JSON Format) :

student_hash3 = {
	key1: value1,
	key2: value2,
	key3: value3
}

how to call the latest 2 values :
student_hash3[:key1]

default values :
if the argument is a string , try to use default as ""
etc etc

csv/array

rspec
describe "#<method_name>" do
	it "test message" do
		# setup
		# exercise
		# verify
	end
end
